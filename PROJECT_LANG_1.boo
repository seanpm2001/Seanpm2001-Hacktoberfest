# About:
# I decided to make Boo the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Hacktoberfest) as this is an article and mini database project on the topic of October software development. Hacktoberfest ends on Halloween, so I feel that Boo fit well as a language here. Not much is really needed here. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.

ADDITIONAL NOTE
Q: Why did you create a Hacktoberfest repository on the last day of October? (2022)
A: I wasn't ready for Hacktoberfest this year, and still needed to create an information repository at a reasonable time. I wanted to draw as little attention to it as possible, in which I succeeded (as of 2022, Friday, November 18th)
